<h3>Task 2 - Data Visualization Dashboard</h3>
<h4>Build a visualization dashboard from the dataset in Task 1 using Tableau.</h4>

<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>
Excel is a great tool for data analysis and visualization, specifically with historical data.

Consider a situation in which you have a large amount of data located in different systems, how might you go about bringing these data together?

What if the data are changing daily or in real-time?

A dashboard is a simple and effective solution to bring together different data sources, making them accessible, and allowing them to be updated frequently.

Excel is indispensable when it comes to financial modeling, statistical and financial calculations, creating data sets, and other mathematically oriented tasks. 
While Excel is great for these types of tasks, it is not suited for pulling multiple datasets and creating dashboards. Tableau on the other hand is a data visualization 
software used for creating dynamic and interactive dashboards that can handle complex visualizations of very large datasets. Each tool has their own purpose, and you 
will often use both tools to perform calculations, build models, and visualize the results to make business decisions. An understanding of Tableau and visualizations 
using dashboards will be an important skill and differentiator for you as you navigate a possible career at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

<h3>Here is your task:</h3>
Your task is to familiarize yourself with the use of Tableau for basic data visualizations, and construct a simple dashboard showing your analysis of the sales 
prospects identified in the home mortgage dataset from Task 1. If you have used Tableau before, this task should be relatively easy; if not, now is the time to dig 
into Tableau and learn the basics.

First, if you do not already have an account with Tableau, create a free account at www.tableau.com. This will give you access to the free version of Tableau which is 
all you need for this task. You can use either the online version or download the desktop version.  

Then, spend some time watching some training videos to become familiar with the basics of Tableau, and how to create a simple dashboard. There are links in Additional 
Resources below, to a few short training videos, but feel free to find more online. 

Then, import the spreadsheet of data used in Task 1 into Tableau, either the original version or the one you made as you modified it. To do this, create a new workbook 
and then connect that workbook to your Excel file as the data source. After importing the Excel file, make sure to check the box that says “Use Data Interpreter” on 
the Data Source tab to have Tableau clean the data for you (which will get rid of rows that are not part of the dataset in the spreadsheet). 

Once you have your data in Tableau, use Tableau to re-create the analysis you did in Task 1, or find other ways to analyze the data using Tableau. You can use the 
“bin” functionality in Tableau to create ranges for different columns in the spreadsheet, for example, and also create calculated fields for simple kinds of data 
aggregation or combinations. For this task, the specific analysis you do is not nearly as important as practicing using the tool and creating dashboards with it.

Finally, use Tableau’s dashboard features to create a simple dashboard combining the analysis you have done to visualize on one screen the most important analyses 
of the data to show insights about qualified sales prospects. Keep your dashboard simple, with just 2- 4 charts that collectively tell the story of your data 
analysis.
